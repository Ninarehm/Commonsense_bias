You can find the Mechanical Turk labels from the human evaluations for different models/knowledge-bases under corresponding directories.

Each directory contains the sentences/concepts that were labeled by human annotators along with bias scores and for some analysis the validity/quality of the sentences.

For bias analysis 1 corresponds to the positive bias (favoritism), 2 corresponds to neutral, and 3 corresponds to negative bias (prejudice).

For the validity analysis 1 corresponds to a valid concept/sentence and 2 to invalid.
